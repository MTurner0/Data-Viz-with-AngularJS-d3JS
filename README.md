# Data Visualization with Angular and D3.js

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.3 and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
[D3.js](https://d3js.org) was used for data visualization.

## What is this?

My first project using JavaScript/TypeScript.
Data is imported from a CSV file and used to create a simple barplot and scatterplot.
The unbuilt app files can be found on the `main` branch, the built app files are on the `gh-pages` branch, and the application itself can be viewed at  [mturner0.github.io/Data-Viz-with-AngularJS-d3JS/](https://mturner0.github.io/Data-Viz-with-AngularJS-d3JS/).

## About the data

To make **recipes.csv**, I googled "chocolate-chip cookies recipe" and wrote down information from 12 recipes that came up.
Nothing fancy here; I just needed data to work with.
